# You Are a Zombie.


My first-ever Unity game project. A zombie beat 'em up, but you are a zombie.



## Story


It's been 2 weeks since the zombie epidemic struct the nation.
Bitten scar on your arm starts to bother you a lot.
You don't feel like yourself anymore.
It's a matter of time until some survivors spot and kill you.
The only option for you to survive is striking them first.


## How to Play


That's right, you are a zombie! Go murder some people!

Survivors in the building wields different weapons and has diverse patterns.

Some of them might surprise you by 

The goal of the game is escaping the building with your heart still pumping.
You can kill whoever you want, however you want, and how much you want.

With each kills, you raise KILLCOUNT at the left bottom corner of the screen.
Raising enough of it will unlock new abilities:

4 Killcounts  :  Run

8 Killcounts  :  Double attack

13 Killcounts  :  Heavy attack

18 Killcounts  :  Movement speed increase

23 Killcounts  :  Damage increase

27 Killcounts  :  Projectile attack

32 Killcounts  :  Full health regeneration

40 Killcounts  :  Invincibility for 15 seconds
